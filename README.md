## ENMpipe
#### A pipeline for developing and testing Ecological Niche Models (ENM): from data mining to pub ready plots.

This ENMpipe is fully implemented in R using many open access packages to download, process, analyze, and visualize spatial data. The scripts are well annotated and will need little technical knowledge other than R basics and require a bit of thinking about the parameters that are being set. The pipleline is organized in two ways: 1. as a fully annotated *tutorial* of independednt steps that can be executed in stages (for beginners), and 2. a semi-annotated & streamlined *full* script (more advanced).

Uses for different steps of the pipe include:
- search, download, and wrangling of species observations 
- spatial data filtering and preprocessing
- environmental data download and clipping to specific geographic extents
- parameter fine tuning for ecological niche models
- ecological niche model development and and projections (across geographic space and time)
- creation of publication ready maps of predicted distributions
- estimates of niche overlap and quantification of niche dynamics
