## ENMpipes
#### A pipeline for developing and testing Ecological Niche Models (ENM): from data mining to pub ready plots.

This ENMpipe is fully implemented in R using many open access packages to download, process, analyze, and visualize spatial data. The scripts are well annotated and will need little technical knowledge other than R basics and require a bit of thinking about the parameters that are being set. The pipleline is organized as independednt steps that can be executed as stages.

Uses for different steps of the pipe include:
```
- search, download, and wrangling of species observations 
- spatial data filtering and preprocessing
- environmental data download and clipping to specific geographic extents
- parameter fine tuning for ecological niche models
- ecological niche model development and and projections (across geographic space and time)
- creation of publication ready maps of predicted distributions
- estimates of niche overlap and quantification of niche dynamics
```
